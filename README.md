# Convolutional-Autoencoder

Auto-Encoder(AE) is a feedforward neural network that learns efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. 

It is based on an encoder-decoder paradigm, where an encoder first transforms an input into a typically lower-dimensional representation, and a decoder is tuned to reconstruct the initial input from this representation through the minimization of a cost function.

It has been applied in different application areas such as dimensionality reduction, reconstructing corrupted data, compact representations of images, Latent space clustering and generative models learning.

In this work, we performed two types of Simple Autoencoder (SAE) and Convolutional Autoencoder (SAE)
